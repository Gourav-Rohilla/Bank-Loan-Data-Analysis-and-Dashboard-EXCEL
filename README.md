Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Once the raw data was collected, it was cleaned and processed to ensure consistency and accuracy. This step included removing duplicate records, handling missing values, correcting data formatting errors .The goal was to ensure the data was ready for analysis by converting it into a structured and usable format.

**Data Analysis:** After cleaning the data, various analytical techniques were applied to gain insights into the loan portfolio.
Dashboard Creation: The next step was to create an interactive, user-friendly dashboard using Excel or other BI tools.
Insights Extraction: With the analysis complete and the dashboard in place, the next step was to derive actionable insights from the data. This included:

Identifying high-risk loans based on credit scores, payment histories, and other financial metrics.
Analyzing loan repayment behavior, pinpointing trends in early vs. late payments.These insights were presented to stakeholders to help guide decisions on loan approvals, portfolio management, and credit risk strategies.
